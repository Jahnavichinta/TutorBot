## Project Overview
The AI-Powered Teaching Assistant provides interactive educational support to users, offering explanations, hints, and answers based on questions or prompts. It uses Generative AI to assist with subject matter comprehension, facilitating student learning through real-time interaction.

### How Does the Project Solve the Challenge?
This project addresses the challenge of providing personalized educational support by leveraging GenAI for real-time interactions. It helps users learn at their own pace with intelligent guidance, making learning accessible and adaptive.

### Why is GenAI the Best Way to Solve It?
GenAI models are adept at natural language understanding and generation, making them perfect for delivering dynamic, conversational educational support. They can provide tailored feedback, hints, and personalized explanations, improving user engagement and learning outcomes.

## Features
- **Real-time Conversation**: Users can ask any question, and the assistant provides insightful responses.
- **Hints and Guidance**: Instead of giving direct answers, the assistant offers hints, encouraging problem-solving.
- **Multi-modal Support**: Capable of analyzing and responding to image inputs (for future integration).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for a seamless experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Generative AI API**: Google Gemini API
- **Styling**: CSS
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

The architecture consists of:
- **Frontend** (React): Handles user interaction and displays chat responses.
- **Backend** (FastAPI): Manages requests from the frontend and integrates with the GenAI API.
- **Generative AI API**: Processes user prompts and generates responses.
- **Database (optional)**: Can be integrated to store previous conversations or feedback.
